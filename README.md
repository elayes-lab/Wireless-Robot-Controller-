# 🎮 PS2 Controlled nRF24L01 Wireless Robot System

## 📝 Project Overview

This repository contains the Arduino code for a wireless robot control system utilizing an **nRF24L01** radio module for communication and a **PlayStation 2 (PS2) controller** for user input. The system consists of two main parts: a **Transmitter** (client) that reads PS2 controller inputs and sends them wirelessly, and a **Receiver** (server) robot that receives these commands and controls its motors accordingly.

This setup is ideal for hobbyists building remote-controlled vehicles, robotics platforms, or any project requiring robust wireless command input with the familiarity of a gaming controller.

## 📸 PS2 Controller Design

The system is designed to leverage the standard PS2 controller's layout for intuitive control. Below is an image illustrating the common design of a PS2 controller. The code maps various button presses and joystick movements to specific commands for the robot.

> **Note:** A directory named `Psx` containing the necessary PS2 controller library will be pushed to this repository alongside the code.
